# WCF - RegistryQuestion Plugin

This plugin adds selfmade questions at registry page to an WCF1 (Woltlab Community Framework) driven site like the Woltlab Burning Board Lite.

You can use the buildPackage.sh to create an installable tar package for any wcf driven application.

The package will be located in the created build/ directory as installPackage.tar

The building artifacts are also contained inside the build folder.
